[ArchivesSpace ASnake Scripts](https://github.com/ruthtillman/ASpaceASnake/)

Scripts primarily related to managing creation and updates of subject records, including adding URIs and deleting subjects. Includes script to add subjects to resource records.

Also includes a script to download top containers and output a CSV with information about the lock version, indicator, URI, and collection/series identifiers if they exist.

Some language cleanup scripts meant to address the finding aid language/script changes which turn "undefined" into English and Latin (because if it's in another language, and a few are, we have already encoded that). Probably not useful for folks who aren't local.
